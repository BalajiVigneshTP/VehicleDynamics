Vehicle Dynamics

🔧 1. Understand the Vehicle Dynamics
📍 Longitudinal Dynamics (Forward/Backward Motion):
Governed by: Engine/Brake forces, road grade, drag, rolling resistance.

States: Velocity, acceleration, wheel slip.

Typical Control Objectives:

Cruise control

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

Traction control

📍 Lateral Dynamics (Side-to-Side Motion):
Governed by: Steering input, lateral tire forces, yaw rate, sideslip angle.

States: Yaw rate, sideslip angle, lateral acceleration.

Typical Control Objectives:

Lane keeping

Lane change

Electronic Stability Control (ESC)

🧩 2. Model the Vehicle
Use simplified models for control design:

➤ Bicycle Model (most common for lateral control):
Assumes two wheels (front and rear)

Captures essential lateral dynamics

Inputs: Steering angle, longitudinal speed

States: Yaw rate, lateral velocity, sideslip angle

➤ Longitudinal Model:
Newton’s law: 
𝐹
=
𝑚
𝑎
F=ma

Consider tire forces, braking/acceleration commands

Can include powertrain and brake actuator dynamics

Use MATLAB/Simulink or Python for modeling and simulation.

🎯 3. Define Control Goals and Constraints
Maintain stability and comfort

Follow reference paths or velocity profiles

Avoid excessive tire slip

Act within actuator limits (steering angle, acceleration, braking)

🧠 4. Select and Design Control Algorithms
✅ Lateral Control Techniques:
PID Control – Simple, effective for small deviations

Model Predictive Control (MPC) – Optimal, handles constraints and multivariable systems

LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) – Good for stability and performance balance

Path-following algorithms – Pure pursuit, Stanley method (common in autonomous driving)

✅ Longitudinal Control Techniques:
PID Controller – For basic cruise control

MPC – For ACC and cooperative adaptive cruise

Rule-based logic – Often used in combination with safety layers

Sliding Mode Control – Robust to model uncertainties and disturbances

🧪 5. Validate in Simulation
Use Simulink Vehicle Dynamics Blockset or CarSim for realistic simulations

Apply test maneuvers (e.g., double lane change, step inputs)

Test under different conditions: friction levels, vehicle load, road grades

🚗 6. Test on Hardware (HIL/SIL)
Software-in-the-loop (SIL): Validate control logic without real hardware

Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL): Integrate ECUs, sensors, actuators

Monitor system latency, actuator delays, and real-world disturbances

📚 Tools and Resources:
MATLAB/Simulink (Vehicle Dynamics Blockset)

IPG CarMaker, dSPACE ASM, VI-Grade for high-fidelity simulation

Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree (Lateral/longitudinal control modules)
